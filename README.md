# Web Scraping iPhone 14 Reviews from Amazon

## Project Overview
This project is designed to scrape reviews of the iPhone 14 from Amazon product pages. It extracts important data such as customer reviews, ratings, and feedback. However, since scraping Amazon directly violates their terms of service, this script is for educational purposes only. In practice, it is recommended to use Amazon's Product Advertising API to legally access this data.

## Features
- Scrapes iPhone 14 reviews and ratings.
- Saves data in a structured format (CSV/JSON).
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Basic sentiment analysis on reviews (optional).

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- BeautifulSoup4 (`pip install beautifulsoup4`)
- Requests (`pip install requests`)
- Pandas (for data processing) (`pip install pandas`)
- Optional: Scrapy (if using a full scraping framework) (`pip install scrapy`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amazon-iphone14-scraper.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd amazon-iphone14-scraper
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the `scraper.py` file and replace the Amazon URL with the link to the iPhone 14 product page.
2. Run the scraper:
   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```
3. The scraped data will be saved as `iphone14_reviews.csv` or `iphone14_reviews.json`.

## Important Notes
- **Legal Disclaimer**: Scraping Amazon without their consent is against their terms of service. Use this script at your own risk, and consider using Amazonâ€™s API for legitimate data access.
- If running into bot detection issues, you may need to implement a more advanced method such as rotating proxies or user agents.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate Amazon Product Advertising API for legal data access.
- Implement more sophisticated error handling and logging.
- Perform natural language processing (NLP) on review data to extract insights like sentiment analysis.
